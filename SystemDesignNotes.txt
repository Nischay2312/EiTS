-------------------DESIGN NOTES--------------------------
main task:
-manages the other tasks : button info, battery management and video playing.
-button inputs: single tap: start/stop the video file. 
-if a notification from button task is received then store and acto accordingly.
-routinely checks battery. if a long tap is received and video is paused then display battery info.
-if battery info falls below a threhold, then force on battery charge
-if a single tap is received then send the videotask a queue notification to start/stop the video playback.
-if a double tap is received then send the video task a queue notification to go to next item.

videoPlaying task:
-manages mjpeg play and mp3 play
-repeats the file
-checks if received a new queue object which tells whether to play/pause or go to next file.


-transfering data from the video player task
make a structure and let it contain the values
